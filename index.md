### Developers + Beers = Awesomesauce!

devbeers is an __awesome__ event for __developers__ to __drink beer__, get some time away from the keyboard, and talk about your __favorite language, IDE or API__. Want to talk about Ruby, Python, Javascript, Node, Go, C#, PHP, Java, Objective-C, Scala? Come over, grab a beer, and start chatting!

Every month we'll be at a __different venue and a different date__, so be sure to keep your eyes out. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devbeers), like us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/devbeers) or sign up to our mailing list to keep up with the beers.
