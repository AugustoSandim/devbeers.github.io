#devbeers

This is the website for [devbeers.io](http://devbeers.io), the event where developers meet for a beer, and to talk about their favorite languages, frameworks, APIs, or whatever else comes to mind.

Our mission is to unite developers from all communities!

To run it:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Theme

The theme we are using is Balzac for Jekyll by ColeTownsend. This is forked from [ColeTownsend](https://github.com/ColeTownsend/Balzac-for-Jekyll), that was forked from [minimal mistakes](http://mademistakes.com). If you like it, send him a shout out at [@twnsndco](https://twitter.com/twnsndco).
